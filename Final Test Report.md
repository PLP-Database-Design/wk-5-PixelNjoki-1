## Test Plan

### Objectives

- Ensure random letter generation and scoring function work correctly.
- Verify user inputs, hints, and leaderboard persistence operate as expected.
- Confirm UI updates for 'score', 'solved' and 'Bonus at' are correct and timely.

### Scope 

**In Scope:**
- User input handling and validation.
- Hint functionality and correctness.
- New Puzzle generation and Reset behaviour.
- Leaderboard persistence and sorting logic.

**Out of Scope:**
- multiplayer features not implemented

### Tools & Resources

- Chrome (latest stable) — recommended test browser
- VS Code — development / test scripting
- GitHub Issues / Projects — defect tracking and collaboration
- chrome DevTools-UI responsiveness

## Risk Analysis

### Risks

| ID | Feature | Risk Description | Likelihood | Impact | Priority | Mitigation Strategy |
|----|---------|------------------|------------|--------|----------|---------------------|
| R-01 | Leaderboard |  incorrect sorting → wrong top-3 shown | Medium | High | High | Add unit tests for sorting;snapshot after updates |
| R-02 | Reset Game | State not fully cleared → residual score persists | Low | High | Medium | Add integration test for reset; ensure reset function resets all relevant state variables |
| R-03 | Bonus Round | Bonus multiplier applied incorrectly (off-by-one) | Medium | Medium | Medium | Add boundary tests for round counters; add logging around multiplier calculation |
| R-04 | UI Responsiveness | Controls overlap at small widths → usability degradation | Medium | Medium | Medium | Add responsive checks in Chrome DevTools; add simple CSS fixes or constraints |
| R-05 | Input Validation | Invalid characters break scoring or crash the app | Low | High | Medium | Sanitize and validate inputs; add negative tests for special characters and scripts |
| R-06 | Persistence | localStorage corruption prevents leaderboard save | Low | Low | Low | Limit stored entries; implement graceful fallback (in-memory) and user notification |

### Risk Coverage

- Total identified risks: 6
- Risks covered by test cases: 6
- Tested Risks Percent: 100%
- Untested Risks Percent: 0%

## Test Cases

| ID | Feature | Objective | Steps (summary) | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status | Risk Link |
|----|---------|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|--------|-----------|
| TC-01 | Leaderboard | Verify top-3 sorting logic | Submit scores 70,80,180 → open leaderboard | Scores shown 180,80,70| 180,80,70 | Pass | R-01 |
| TC-02 | Reset Game | Verify Reset clears score & progress | Play to score >0 → Click Reset | Score=0, puzzle index resets | Score & index reset | Pass | R-02 |
| TC-03 | Bonus Round | Verify every 3rd puzzle applies x2 multiplier | Complete puzzles 1–3 and note points | Puzzle 3 points = base ×2 | Multiplier applied correctly | Pass | R-03 |
| TC-04 | Input Validation (Negative) | Ensure invalid inputs don't crash app | Submit "<script>" as answer | App sanitizes/blocks input; no crash | App threw an error | Fail | R-05 |
| TC-05 | Leaderboard (Boundary) | Verify only top 3 scores persist | Submit >3 scores with varying values | Only top-3 are stored | Top-3 retained | Pass | R-01 |
| TC-06 | Usability | New user can complete tutorial puzzle | Observe new user attempting tutorial | User completes with minor confusion (notes) | not Completed; no notes recorded | fail | R-04 |
| TC-07 | Reset + Persistence (Negative) | Reset does not clear leaderboard | Save score → Reset → check leaderboard | Leaderboard remains intact | Leaderboard intact | Pass | R-02, R-06 |
| TC-08 | Performance | App responsiveness under diffrent screen sizes | adapt to diffrent screen sizes | UI responds properly, no glitch| Responsive; acceptable | Pass | R-04 |

### Phases

| Phase | Deliverable | Actual Output | Variance | Owner |
|-------|-------------|---------------|----------|-------|
| Planning | Test plan & risk list | Completed | 2hrs| Test Manager |
| Design | Test cases documented | Completed | 2hrs | Risk Analyst |
| Execution | Test execution & evidence | Completed (see table) | 6hrs | Test Executor |
| Triage | Defect triage & retest | pending | - | All |

**Progress Tracking Method:** GitHub Issues for defects, markdown files, risk analysis ,test cases and this report for metrics.

**Change Control Notes:** Any scope deviation or blocked tests were recorded as issues and communicated via the project board.

## Lessons Learned

- Most defect prone feature: User Interface input (R-05) — no filtering and verification of input
- Risk analysis impact: Prioritizing user input test found high-impact defects early.
- Team communication effectiveness: Daily short syncs helped coordinate testing
- Improvements for the next cycle: Add small unit tests for core logic (sorting, multiplier) and automate a smoke test that runs on each push.

## Overall Summary

Statement:
The team executed the planned test cases against the Word Puzzle Game Plus. Most planned test cases passed (75% pass rate). one high-severity defect was identified and still open and one medium-severity defect remains open. The team recommends prioritizing the open defects before final sign-off and adding small automated checks for sorting and input validation.

Test Status: ☐ Completed / ☑ In Progress / ☐ Deferred
